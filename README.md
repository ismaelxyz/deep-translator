# Deep Translator

A flexible free and unlimited rust tool to translate between different languages in a simple way using multiple translators

## Use example

```sh
deep-translator --text=cane google
```

## Motivation

I was previously developing a project called SimpleT, a translator with a graphical interface written in Rust using the Egui library and Python in the backend, especially for translations. However, I encountered problems because the graphical interface was very slow due to the interfacing. For this reason, I decided to rewrite everything in Rust.

## Collaboration
I invite everyone who wants to do their part to keep this software updated and functional to make issues and prs regarding what they think needs to be corrected or improved
